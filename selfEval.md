# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
1. I am proud of being able to connect a function to a conditional! I always see all of the stuff on tv and I can't beleive I'm doing it!!
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
1. They're important because they perform tasks all over our technology. It seems like everything must have a function in order to exist.
